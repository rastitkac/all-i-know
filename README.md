# Introduction

This is my personal wiki where I store and share things I know about this world.  
It is served [online](https://wiki.rastitkac.net) in form of a [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rastitkac/all-i-know).

## Inspiration

I was heavily inspired to start making this wiki by amazing [Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) by [Nikita Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/). You can support him on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) and check out his [other projects](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects).
